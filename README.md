# sh51
a mini shell for 8051 MCU

communicate with PC through UART.
recommand using Putty under Windows.

only two commands are implemented for now: hp(help), ex(exit).
other functions will be added when I have more free time.

How to compile:
make.bat sh51

you will get a sh51.hex file, which can be downloaded to the MCU51.
